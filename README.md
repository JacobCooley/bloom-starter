# Bloom Starter

This is a starter kit for react/redux projects.

### Installation and Set Up
1. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
    * If you don't have yarn installed, follow the instructions here: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install


2. For front-end debugging, you will need React and Redux Chrome dev tools. You can find them here:
    * [React Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
    * [Redux Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)


3. Boot up the server in the root directory with `npm run dev`. By default, it's served on port 8080.

## Build
1. `npm run build` to generate a production bundle.
